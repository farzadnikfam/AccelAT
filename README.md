# AccelAT
A Framework for Accelerating the Adversarial Training of Deep Neural Networks through Accuracy Gradient

This is the code of AccelAT framework, you can find the main paper at: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9915577 (DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3213734).

The main file is accelat.py, to use correctly the code you have to install the packages of accelat.yml in your environment.

If you want to obtain the results directly on your phone you have to create a telegram bot and compile the telegram_bot.txt file before starting.
